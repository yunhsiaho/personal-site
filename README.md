# Personal-site
I'm developping this react-based website to practice my **WEB DEV** and **WEB DESIGN** skills.  Progress has been slower than I expected due to some changes in my personal life, but I will surely come back to work on it as soon as possible.  I've put a lot of effort in my design, I like it so much and I really want to make it real.

## Description
This project, developed using **React.js** in **VS Code**, started as a fun side project at the beginning of 2024. I want to create it as a portfolio to showcase and manage all the side projects that I've done. The development is saved on dev branch before merging to the main branch in case of any mistake.

## Status
**Dev in progress**

## Design
This design is made by figma, where I learnt the skill from the online UX design course by GOOGLE on Coursera platform.
